# My React Portfolio

## Description
This portfolio showcases my projects and skills as a web developer. It is built using React and highlights my journey in coding, particularly during my time in the University of Toronto Bootcamp. As a beekeeper, I aim to implement code that benefits beekeepers worldwide by gathering data to better understand honeybees and native bees.
