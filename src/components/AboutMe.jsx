        Welcome to my React portfolio! I am currently studying at the UofT Bootcamp, where I've developed skills in web development.
        As a beekeeper, I aim to implement code that benefits beekeepers worldwide by gathering data to better understand honeybees and native bees.
        This portfolio includes a section about me, my resume, and my contact information where you can reach me.
