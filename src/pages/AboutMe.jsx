      <p>
        Hello, my name is Alexander Braff and I am a new web developer with experience in building full-stack web applications.
        I am always studying to learn more and to better develop my skills in the field.
        In my spare time I am a beekeeper and an avid reader of the newest technologies.
        I also spend a lot of my spare time learning new programming languages as well as studying Mandarin.
