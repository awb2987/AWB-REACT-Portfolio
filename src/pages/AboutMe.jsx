        My React portfolio describes past projects during my time studying via UofT BOOTCAMP. 
        I am a beekeeper trying to implement code to benefit beekeepers worldwide through gathering 
        data to better understand honeybees as well as native bees. This portfolio includes a section 
        about me, my resume, and my contact information where you can reach me.
